Management has come to recognize that most of the \n   Data Scientists from India are vegans and require suitable and quality \n   living environment while they are in North America for their 6 months training. \n   Its important that their  specific requirements with regards to food and other aspects \n   of Vegans lifestyles are respected and enabled to ensure optimum learning and skills \n   acquisition by the new Data Scientists.\n\n   IT companies face the \"Business Problem\" of helping the new Data Scientists in a \n   logical  manner with their choice of either to live in NY or Toronto which are the \n   two major training centers in North America. It is envisaged that relevant recommendations \n   capturing the core features (i.e Vegan restaurants,&  Community Centers ) \n   of the 2 cities with respect to Vegans Lifestyle would be very helpful for the new-hires.\n\n   Alternatively the problem statement can be captured by the Question below...\n\n   \" How can IT companies help their overseas Vegan staff to choose between which \n   Neighborhoods in NY / Toronto to live during their 6-months training ? \"\n\n   The core objective of this Data Science project is to conduct a neighborhood \n   comparative analysis for NY and Toronto with specific emphasis on the 2 lifestyle \n   features of \"Eating Places/restaurants\" and \"Community/Social \n   Centers\" and enable relevant & valuable recommendations about the City."

The main variable of focus was only Food & Leisure where as Vegans may be interested in a number of other amenities and interests that will make it a multi-variable focused data science analysis. From my perspective the project has afforded me a tremendous opportunity to explore and apply most of the knowledge and insights gained during the previous 8 modules of this course."
